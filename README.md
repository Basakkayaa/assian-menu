# Assian Menu

This project belongs to an assignment from the Javascript course I completed on Patika.dev. <br>
Assignment content: Creating a menu for Asian cuisine and having the appropriate menus appear on the screen as you click on the options. As an extra, I added a login form and registration form to this assignment. I will make adjustments to this project as I further my education.
